What your computer experience has been so far? Include any interesting projects that you've worked on or interesting courses you've taken?
I am in my junior year of Computer Science and I also have a Computer Information Systems associates degree. I know Java, Python, Visual Basic, Assembly in MIPS, html and css. I also developed a proof of concept version of a stock market portfolio manager utilizing actual stock market data in real time. 

Where do you see yourself using what you learn in this course?
I wish to further develop my ability to create web applications for any future projects that may require me to make websites with intricate designs and integrations.
